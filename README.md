# Adhesive-Redshift-Hypothesis
Cosmological redshift as emergent from variable fundamental constants  
# Adhesive Redshift Hypothesis 

**Theoretical framework proposing:**  
- 🌌 Novel 5D spacetime geometry with hyperspherical boundary (SNP)  
- 🔴 Cosmological redshift as emergent from variable fundamental constants  
- ⚡ Dark energy as curvature energy discharge  

**Current status:**  
⚠️ Proof-of-concept stage | Predicts z<3 anomalies (Hα-CaII Δz ~0.003)  
✅ Matches 67% Planck CMB parameters | Testable with ALPHA-g
